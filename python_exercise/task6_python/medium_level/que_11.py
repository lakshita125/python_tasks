'''We are making n stone piles! The first pile has n stones. If n is even,
then all piles have an even number of stones. If n is odd, all piles have an odd number of stones.
Each pile must have more stones than the previous pile but as few as possible.
Write a Python program to find the number of stones in each pile.
